# 3DPrinterCompany-database-SQL


The 3D Printers Company case was a project designed and implemented for the acquisition of knowledge and potential that derive from the SQL language and the efficient usability of the servers made available for the creation of data management, exploiting the potential of the Internet.
The project basically aims at the creation of a database for the management of company data, which can be accessed and updated by the employees who are part of the company (via a 'Notebook' or 'IPad' handheld device). The database aims at categorization of categories such as workers, customers, employees, invoices and products intended for sale (3D printers, filaments and spare parts). All these categories are linked via 'queries' to each other, thus allowing traceability and relationships in maintenance processes and corporate arrival, for an efficiency and organization worthy of a company in step with the times.
